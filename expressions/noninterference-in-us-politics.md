# Noninterference in US Politics

The Sordelia project does not seek to interfere in the internal affairs or existing politics of the United States.

We seek a peaceful and legal creation of a new nation, in a global location that is yet to-be-determined.

Since we do not yet have a country, nor have our principal place of business in a foreign (to the United States) country, nor are organized under the laws of a foreign country, nor are an arm of any foreign political party, we are not classified as a foreign principal and our individuals are not foreign agents under the United States' Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938. If and when we establish the country of Sordelia, any non-exempt members operating in the United States shall register as foreign agents with Sordelia as their foreign principal. // https://www.justice.gov/nsd-fara/general-fara-frequently-asked-questions
