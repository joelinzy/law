# Welcome to Sordelia

Sordelia is the country for the 21st century promoting liberty, deliberative democracy, and sortitions.

What would a democracy designed in the 21st century look like? We think it should have three major principles: Liberty, protecting both social and economic freedoms; Sortitions, to replace oligarchic representatives with a random sample of voters; and Deliberative Democracy, allowing voters to become better informed with evidence and arguments before voting.

# Proposing Changes

If you would like to propose a change to the laws of Sordelia, you can first create the proposal on the Github repo, then submitting the proposal at [sordelia.org/propoasls/new](https://sordelia.org/propoasls/new). Before creating the proposal, be sure to search for other proposals that are similar to yours, to see what the history is, or if your changes are better aligned with an existing proposal.

What happens next? The Legislative Committee will organize a debate and a vote on proposals. They will group similar proposals together, have the different sides present arguments for their cases, and schedule a vote on the issue. If successful, your proposal will be accepted.
