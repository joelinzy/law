# Debates and Votes

The Legislative Council will schedule, plan, and neutrally run debates and votes.

The Legislative Council may designate neutral presenters to brief the randomly chosen congresses on the issues, including statements of fact agreed upon by the advocates for all the proposals.

The people arguing for a proposal are known as advocates.

A congress may decide on multiple proposals with the same vote, with a maximum of four new proposals per issue. The vote must always include the status quo too (meaning there's a max of five total when including status quo). // E.g. you may decide "do plan A" vs "do plan B" vs "do plan C" vs "status quo" with a single congress, instead of multiple congresses for A, B, and C.

Until we have a country, congresses will be held remotely over the internet. Some may be synchronous (e.g. involve live presentations) but most will be asynchronous (e.g. reading and viewing at the voter's convenience). Once we have a country, it's expected we will hold congresses in person in a medium sized auditorium.

Congress duration is up to the Legislative Council but it's expected most should last less than a day. Companies should provide paid time off for mandatory congress attendance. // Minor issues may take 10 - 20 minutes, small issues perhaps 30 - 60 minutes, medium issues perhaps half a day, and major issues may take more than a single day.

Congresses are accompanied with in depth debate and question and answer from advocates for the proposals and status quo.

Congresses should not be held for the same issue too often, unless there is a compelling reason something changed to warrant the sortition sooner.

Can run many sortitions concurrently on a single day, for different issues. For ex, in a given week, there could be multiple debates occurring to decide various issues.

Multi-issue ranked choice voting will be used.
