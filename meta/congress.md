# Congress

A congress is the standard decision-making body of Sordelia.

Until we have over 250 members, everyone will have a vote on every issue. In this phase, voting is done remotely online, attendance is optional, and we require a 60% threshold.

Once we have more than 250 members, the following process describes how to form a congress.

A congress is formed by taking a simple random sample (a sortition) of all eligible voters. The random algorithm used shall be made publicly available and shall be free of any bias. The congress shall have a sufficient number of voters such that the decision made can be statistically significant.

For now, the random algorithm shall be to list all the voters alphabetically in an array, pick a random seed, use that to shuffle the array, and then select first N voters from the list. // In the future, this process will be improved

While we are operating online, participation will be optional. Eventually, for a person randomly selected, participation in a congress will be mandatory, with rare exceptions requiring proof (e.g. too sick to attend, proof required with a doctor's note).

Congresses will be of at least 250 people.

Congresses require 60% voting threshold to accept a proposal. This is a size large enough such that, in the worst case, less than 0.1% of decisions would have been <50% on a vote of all electorates, meaning if a proposal succeeds, we can be extremely confident it is the majority will of the entire voting populace. In fact, with high probability, the winning proposal had supermajority approval. These numbers are chosen so that, if a proposal passes, we can say with extremely high confidence (about 99.9%) that the proposal would have received at least 50% of the entire electorate. Further, with about 95% confidence, we can say it would have received at least 55% of the entire electorate. If a proposal has support of 2/3 of the electorate, it's likely to pass with about a 99% probability - very rarely will it fail.
