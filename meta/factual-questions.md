# Factual Questions

If all members of the Legislative Council agree, the vote on legislation in a congress may be prepended with up to six neutral factual questions related to the issue. The answers to these factual questions must either be straightforward for a reasonably educated person to answer correctly, or the related concepts must have been presented to the voters such that an attentive listener would know the answers. // These factual questions could be things like "If someone earns $XXXXXX, how much would they pay in the proposal versus the status quo?" or "What percent of the current population are X?"

Answers to these questions shall not change the result of the vote. These answers must be made publicly available for further political science research on deliberative democracy and epistocracy. // The data gathered shall be useful for later citizens to debate whether to include any epistocratic elements to Sordelia, perhaps by use as screening questions for the vote to count.

There shall not be any factual questions prepended during elections for the Legislative Council itself.
