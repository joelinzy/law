# Legislative Council Elections

Until we have a sufficient number of members (>=250) the President shall act in place of a Leglislative Council. The preceeding sentence will be removed once we've reached a scale to elect the Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council shall be made up of five members, elected by a multi-winner ranked choice vote process.

Each member shall designate their succession line, in case they cannot serve out their remaining term for whatever reason (e.g. death, coma, or similar).

The Legislative Council is elected every year with a multi-winner ranked choice vote process. There's a three step process. First, anyone who wants to apply may do so. These are then narrowed down to twelve candidates with a multi-winner ranked choice vote via a congress. The remaining twelve are then narrowed down to five winning candidates with a multi-winner ranked choice vote via another congress.

No person may serve more than four years on the Leglislative Council.
