# Taxation

There shall not be a general sales tax, however narrowly applied Pigovian sales taxes to address a negative externality is allowed.

There is a flat income tax of 20%, applicable to all income, whether from labor, capital gains, or any other method (other methods include without limitation: royalties, lottery winnings, gifts, etc).
// In the future, this can be studied further and perhaps the income tax can be reduced or replaced in part with a value added tax.

This flat income tax applies to all residents of Sordelia.

// With no sales tax and a low income tax, this places Sordelia among the countries with the lowest effective tax rates in the world. The only countries that have lower income taxes generally make up for it with either an alternative tax (e.g. sales tax), prosperous government-controlled industries like oil, or some other form of revenue collection.
