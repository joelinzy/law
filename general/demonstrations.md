# Demonstrations

People have the right to hold public demonstrations peacefully, without acquiring a permit in advance. Such demonstrations shall not block traffic or other people's access to move about freely, nor shall they infringe on any other right of the public.

Demonstrations are not an unbiased expression of the people's will, since those demonstrating come from a skewed subset of the entire population. Instead, a random soritition is an unbiased, statistical expression of the people's will.
