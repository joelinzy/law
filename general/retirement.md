# Retirement

There is no official retirement age, nor tax advantages for saving for retirement.

Companies shall not force retirement at any age, except if it is a bona fide occupational qualification. // Forcing retirement would be a form of age discrimination. An example of a bona fide occupational qualification would be a theater that needs a young actor to play a young character's role.
