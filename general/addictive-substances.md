# Addictive Substances

Because addictive substances interfere with people's self-control and willpower, and are not in sound judgement when addicted, their use is regulated. At the same time, we will not outright ban drugs. Instead, we impose the following conditions:

Non-addictive substances have no restrictions.

Addictive substances must:

- Have with a prominent warning of their addictive tendency seen by virtually all users // for example, cigarettes could have a warning on their cover, which users will surely see before opening, and porn or gambling websites could have a click through warning modal before the site

- Use an industry-wide self-exclusion list where users can prohibit themselves for one month, one year, five years, or a lifetime.

- Provide information about how to seek treatment

The following are considered addictive substances:
Heroin, nicotine, morphine, cocaine, alcohol, caffeine, MDMA, marijuana, porn, gambling

The industry-wide exclusion list means that someone who wishes to be prohibited from one type of substance will not have to exclude themselves from every single provider, so that providers will either agree to share lists or use a third party directory. To prevent this from becoming a monopolistic industry, any new entrant shall have the rights to acquire the data of who is on any other company's list, for free.
