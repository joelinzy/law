# Advance Rulings

Advance rulings are a method for reducing legal uncertainty by getting a ruling on a situation that may be hypothetical.

The person or company requesting the advance ruling must pay additional fees for the privilege of the advance ruling.

Further, the advance ruling may keep the requestor anonymous, because otherwise many requestors would prefer to remain in the dark, strategically avoiding additional legal scrutiny. This means the payments and filings come from their lawyer on behalf of the anonymous requestor.

Advance rulings must be published publicly.

Courts should follow advance rulings to the extent they would follow other precedent.
