# Freedom from Discrimination

No person shall be unreasonably discriminated against on the basis of ethnicity, place of origin, age, gender, or religion or non-religion.

Jobs may discriminate only with a bona fide occupational qualification. // An example of bona fide occupational qualifications are: a theater that needs a young actor to play a young role, or a fashion company hiring models of a certain gender for their clothing line.

Discrimination against a protected class of people is never justified by historical discrimination conducted by different people. // Sordelia is a brand new country and will not be encumbered with the original sin of slavery or other historical grievances. Two wrongs don't make a right.

No law may unreasonably discriminate against future generations to benefit the present. // An example of what we intend to prevent is the selfishness of California's Prop 13 / Prop 58 / Prop 193 / etc, or the generational wrong that is unrestrained pollution. As a moral principle, future generations should inherit a civilization that is at least as well off as the present.
// What this means is that a direct democracy cannot vote itself unnatural favors at the expense of the young, unborn, and future residents.
// Note that GDP-backed bonds do not discriminate against future generations because every year we will have to pay the same percent of GDP. It would be discriminatory if the percent increased with time, e.g. if the next generation had to pay double the percent of GDP of the present generation. Note that the converse would be acceptable: a law may have the present generation pay a higher rate than future generations, since that is leaving the future better off than the present.
