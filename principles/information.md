# Right to Information

People have a right to public information.

In particular:

- There can be no content restrictions on accessing the internet.

- The law must be made easily accessible, in its entirety, for free. // It's crazy that the law in the United States is so hard to find and search through, and when you do find something, it's possibly out-of-date. Further, case law is even harder to find and often requires a paid subscription with an information broker like LexisNexis.

- People must be informed of what crimes they are accused of, and must have access to all evidence that may be used against them.

- Persons on trial must be provided with an interpreter upon request.
