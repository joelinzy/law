# Right to Crypto

All people have a right to use cryptography. // Unlike other governemnts which try to restrict people's access to cryptography or impose backdoor encryption mandates, Sordelia recognizes the people's right to crypto. This right does not limit a court ability to compel access to encrypted documents with a warrant, for example.
