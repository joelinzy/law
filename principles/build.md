# Right to Build

Property owners have the right to build on their own property. As many people may live in a building as the building will healthily support.

Neighbors do not have the right to prevent property owners from buildings as long as the building is safe and poses little to no risk to its surroundings.

Limits may still apply to the construction methods to limit noise at night, limit aerial pollution, limit smell, etc.

Limits may also apply to unsafe risks, for instance a leaning tower that risks destroying neighboring buildings.

If a neighbor wants to own their view of something, such as an ocean, they should buy air rights over the relevant properties.

Any building permit process must be efficient and inexpensive.

Land and air rights must be maintained in a publicly and freely accessible database.
