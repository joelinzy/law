# Freedom of Immigration

As long as there is sufficient demand of immigrants who share our values, the country must accept immigrant growth of at least X% annually, with a proportional amount accepted each quarter.

X is equal to:

- 100% if the total country's population was less than 100,000 at the start of the year

- 50% if the total country's population was less than 250,000 at the start of the year

- 25% if the total country's population was less than 500,000 at the start of the year

- 10% if the total country's population was less than 750,000 at the start of the year

- 7% if the total country's population is less than 1,000,000 at the start of the year

- 5% if the total country's population is greater than 2,500,000 at the start of the year

These figures are legally guaranteed minimums, but faster growth is possible, too.
