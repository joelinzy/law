# Limit on Taxation

Income taxes shall never exceed 20%. This applies to both personal and organizational or corporate income taxes. // One of the concerns of direct democracy is that the masses will vote for higher and higher taxes, as long as they're not the ones paying for it. This limit on taxation is indended to constrain that possibility. It's a principled limit on the economic intrusiveness of the government.

Income shall include all income of any sort, whether capital gains, salary, other benfits, gifts, or inheritance.
