# Freedom of Action

Everyone is free to engage in any action provided that all affected parties understand the possible consequences of the action and consent to the action.

Exceptions to this principle include: lack of capacity to consent, duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, nondisclosure of important elements, unconscionability, or violations of liberty or human dignity. // For example, you cannot sell yourself into slavery, because that is a violation of human dignity.
