# Freedom of Exit

People shall be free to exit Sordelia without undue burden. // Throughout history, repressive governments have attempted to restrict their people's ability to flee the country, or limit people's ability to take their property with them as they leave. The Freedom of Exit prevents Sordelia from creating any improper restrictions on exit. Examples of proper restrictions are if the person is suspected of a crime or if they owe unpaid taxes.
